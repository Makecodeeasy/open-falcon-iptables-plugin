This python script is used to monitor linux iptables status for open-falcon

You should put this script to the path of open-falcon plugin path. My path is ${OPEN-FALCON_HONE}/agent/plugin/sys . The path "sys" is defined by yourself, also can be other name, but you need configure your falcon HostGroups--plugins in the web to use the your definition name.


This script could run on linux centos 6.5(64 Bit), not tested in other platform
